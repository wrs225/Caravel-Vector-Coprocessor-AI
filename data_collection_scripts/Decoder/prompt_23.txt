When the opcode is unrecognized just assign everything to zero, but make clock_bypass = 1
ChatGPT

Sure, you can modify the default case in the switch statement to assign everything to zero and set clock_bypass to 1 when an unrecognized opcode is encountered. Here's how you can do it:

verilog

default: begin // Unrecognized opcode
    reg_file_addr1 = 5'b0;
    reg_file_addr2 = 5'b0;
    mux_bit = 1'b0;
    vector_reg_write_bit = 1'b0;
    predicate_reg_write_bit = 1'b0;
    scalar_reg_write_bit = 1'b0;
    vector_reg_load_mux_bit = 1'b0;
    scalar_reg_load_mux_bit = 1'b0;
    functional_unit_mux_bit = 3'b0;
    add_subtract_bit = 1'b0;
    load_store_bit = 1'b0;
    clock_enable = 1'b0;
    clock_bypass = 1'b1;
    bitwise_op_select = 2'b0;
    predicate_op_select = 2'b0;
    vector_reg_write_select = 5'b0;
end

This will ensure that the system remains in a safe state when an unrecognized opcode is encountered.
