Can you please write a module definition in SystemVerilog. Also include two 1-bit clock_enable and clock_bypass outputs
ChatGPT

Certainly, I can help you with that. Here is a SystemVerilog module definition based on the specifications you provided. This module takes a 32-bit instruction input, and outputs the various control signals. Note that the actual logic isn't provided because it is specific to your instruction set architecture.

systemverilog

module InstructionDecoder (
    input wire [31:0] instruction,
    input wire clk,
    output reg [4:0] dest_reg,
    output reg [4:0] src_reg1,
    output reg [4:0] src_reg2,
    output reg mux_bit,
    output reg vector_reg_write_bit,
    output reg predicate_reg_write_bit,
    output reg scalar_reg_write_bit,
    output reg vector_reg_load_mux_bit,
    output reg scalar_reg_load_mux_bit,
    output reg [2:0] functional_unit_mux_bit,
    output reg add_subtract_bit,
    output reg clock_enable,
    output reg clock_bypass
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Extract fields from instruction
    wire [4:0] opcode = instruction[31:27];
    dest_reg = instruction[26:22];
    src_reg1 = instruction[21:17];
    src_reg2 = instruction[16:12];

    // Decode opcode and set control bits
    // This is just a placeholder. The actual logic depends on your specific instruction set.
    // case (opcode) ...

    // Set clock control bits
    // This is also a placeholder. The actual logic depends on your specific needs.
    // clock_enable = ...;
    // clock_bypass = ...;
end

endmodule

In this module, I've assumed that the clock signal is input to the module and that the control signals are updated on the rising edge of the clock. Depending on your design, you might want to change this to be combinational or to be sensitive to different clock edges.

Also, the actual opcode decoding logic and the logic to set the clock_enable and clock_bypass bits are not included in this module, as they depend on your specific instruction set architecture and your clocking strategy.
