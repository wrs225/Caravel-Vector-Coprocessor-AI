Can you please add 5 output bits for the vector register file write select?

Sure! Here's how you could modify your module definition to include this new output:

systemverilog

module decoder (
    input logic [31:0] instruction,
    input logic instruction_valid,
    output logic clock_bypass,
    output logic clock_enable,
    output logic mux_bit,
    output logic vector_reg_write_bit,
    output logic predicate_reg_write_bit,
    output logic scalar_reg_write_bit,
    output logic vector_reg_load_mux_bit,
    output logic scalar_reg_load_mux_bit,
    output logic [2:0] functional_unit_mux_bit,
    output logic add_subtract_bit,
    output logic load_store_bit,
    output logic [1:0] bitwise_op_select,
    output logic [1:0] predicate_op_select,
    output logic [4:0] vector_reg_write_select
);

To update vector_reg_write_select, you'll likely want to add another output assignment for this signal in each case of your case statement. For example, if your Vector Register File write address comes from bits 5:9 of the instruction, your VLOAD and VSTORE instructions might look like this:

systemverilog

5'b00000: begin // Load instruction (VLOAD)
    // other output assignments...
    vector_reg_write_select = instruction[9:5];
end

5'b00001: begin // Store instruction (VSTORE)
    // other output assignments...
    vector_reg_write_select = 5'b00000; // no write for store operation
end

This is just an example. You'll need to modify the assignments for vector_reg_write_select based on how you're using this signal in your design.
