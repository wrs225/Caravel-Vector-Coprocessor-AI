If there is a 1 in the 23rd bit of y_frac_intermediate, we should not do the normalization with the LUT. Modify the shift_amount assignment to do nothing when the 23rd bit is zero. Do not use Show me Diagrams

Here's a sequence diagram illustrating the logic for determining the shift amount:

You can view this diagram in a new tab.

You can edit this diagram online if you want to make any changes.

The type of the diagram is a sequence diagram in Mermaid language.

Based on this logic, you can modify the shift_amount assignment in the SystemVerilog code as follows:

systemverilog

// Normalize result using LUT
shift_amount = y_frac_intermediate[23] ? 5'b00000 : LUT[y_frac_intermediate[22:18]];

This code checks if the 23rd bit of y_frac_intermediate is 1. If it is, it sets shift_amount to 0 (no shift). Otherwise, it sets shift_amount to the value from the lookup table.
