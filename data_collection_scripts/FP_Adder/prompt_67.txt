Keep the shift part for a_frac, please
ChatGPT

Sure, if you want to keep the shift for a_frac but still subtract a_frac from b_frac, you can modify the line as follows:

verilog

y_frac_intermediate = b_frac - (a_frac >> (b_exp - a_exp));

This line of code will right-shift a_frac based on the difference in exponents, and then subtract the result from b_frac.
