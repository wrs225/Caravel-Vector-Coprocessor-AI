Your implementation breaks my multiplier.
ChatGPT

I apologize for any confusion. The implementation I provided is a simplified version of a floating-point multiplier and may not be suitable for all use cases. It's also important to note that floating-point multiplication is a complex operation that involves many edge cases, such as handling of special values (NaNs, infinities, zeros), denormalized numbers, and rounding.

If you could provide more details about the specific issues you're encountering with the implementation, I would be happy to help troubleshoot and provide a more tailored solution. For example, it would be helpful to know:

    What specific behavior or output is incorrect?
    Are there specific inputs that cause the problem?
    Are there any constraints or requirements that the current implementation doesn't meet?

With more information, I can provide a more accurate and useful response.
