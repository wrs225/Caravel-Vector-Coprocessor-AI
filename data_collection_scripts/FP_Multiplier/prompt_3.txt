Implement it using simple low-level logic and no special functions
ChatGPT

Implementing a floating-point multiplier using low-level logic is quite complex because it involves several steps such as extracting the sign, exponent, and mantissa from the input floating-point numbers, performing the multiplication, and then normalizing and rounding the result. Here is a simplified version of a floating-point multiplier that does not handle special cases such as NaNs, infinities, or denormals, and does not perform rounding.

systemverilog

module fp_multiplier(
    input logic [31:0] a, // input a
    input logic [31:0] b, // input b
    output logic [31:0] y // output y
);
    logic [7:0] a_exponent, b_exponent, y_exponent;
    logic [22:0] a_mantissa, b_mantissa, y_mantissa;
    logic a_sign, b_sign, y_sign;

    // Extract the sign, exponent, and mantissa from the inputs
    assign a_sign = a[31];
    assign a_exponent = a[30:23];
    assign a_mantissa = {1'b1, a[22:0]};

    assign b_sign = b[31];
    assign b_exponent = b[30:23];
    assign b_mantissa = {1'b1, b[22:0]};

    // Perform the multiplication
    assign y_sign = a_sign ^ b_sign;
    assign y_exponent = a_exponent + b_exponent - 127;
    assign y_mantissa = a_mantissa * b_mantissa;

    // Normalize the result (assumes that the result is not zero)
    always_comb begin
        if (y_mantissa[23] == 1'b1) begin
            y_mantissa = y_mantissa >> 1;
            y_exponent = y_exponent + 1;
        end
    end

    // Combine the sign, exponent, and mantissa into the output
    assign y = {y_sign, y_exponent, y_mantissa[22:0]};
endmodule

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a floating-point multiplier and is not suitable for most practical applications. A real floating-point multiplier would need to handle special cases such as NaNs, infinities, and denormals, and would need to perform rounding according to the IEEE 754 standard. Implementing these features using low-level logic is quite complex and beyond the scope of this response.
