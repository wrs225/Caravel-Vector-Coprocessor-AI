I have the following module interface for predicate register instructions. Make this comparison unit so it complies with the provided ISA:
module comparison_unit #(parameter WIDTH = 32)(
    input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in1,
    input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in2,
    input logic [1:0] control,
    output logic predicate
);

endmodule
Here is the ISA:
Instruction	Opcode	Operand 1	Operand 2	Operand 3	Description

VSTORE	0x01	Vsrc	Saddr	Slen	Store a vector from Vsrc to memory. The base address is in Saddr, and the length is in Slen.
VADD	0x02	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Add two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 + Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VSUB	0x03	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Subtract two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 - Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VMUL	0x04	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Multiply two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 * Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VSMUL	0x05	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Multiply a vector by a scalar. Vsrc * Ssrc -> Vdest.
VSADD	0x06	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Add a scalar to a vector. Vsrc + Ssrc -> Vdest.
VFADD	0x07	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Add two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 + Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VFMUL	0x08	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Multiply two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 * Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VFSMUL	0x15	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Multiply a floating-point vector by a scalar. Vsrc * Ssrc -> Vdest.
VFSADD	0x16	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Add a scalar to a floating-point vector. Vsrc + Ssrc -> Vdest.
VAND	0x09	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise AND operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 AND Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VOR	0x0A	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise OR operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 OR Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VXOR	0x0B	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise XOR operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 XOR Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VPSETZ	0x0C	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc that is zero, and 0 otherwise.
VPSETN	0x0D	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc that is non-zero, and 0 otherwise.
VPSET	0x0E	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc.
VPSGE	0x0F	Pdest	Ssrc1	Ssrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc1 that is signed greater than or equal to the corresponding element in Ssrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VPSLT	0x18	Pdest	Ssrc1	Ssrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc1 that is signed less than the corresponding element in Ssrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VPUGE	0x19	Pdest	Ssrc1	Ssrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc1 that is unsigned greater than or equal to the corresponding element in Ssrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VPULT	0x1A	Pdest	Ssrc1	Ssrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc1 that is unsigned less than the corresponding element in Ssrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VFSUB	0x10	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Subtract two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 - Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VPEQ	0x14	Pdest	Psrc1	Psrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 if Psrc1 is equal to Psrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VPNEQ	0x17	Pdest	Psrc1	Psrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 if Psrc1 is not equal to Psrc2, and 0 otherwise.

It looks like you want to design a comparison unit that complies with the provided ISA, specifically for predicate register instructions. The instructions related to predicate registers in the given ISA include VPSETZ, VPSETN, VPSET, VPSGE, VPSLT, VPUGE, VPULT, VPEQ, and VPNEQ.

The control signal can be used to select the specific operation to be performed. Since there are 9 different predicate-related instructions, you'll need at least 4 bits to represent them. However, the current control signal is only 2 bits wide, so you'll need to expand it.

Here's a revised module interface with a 4-bit control signal:

verilog

module comparison_unit #(parameter WIDTH = 32)(
    input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in1,
    input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in2,
    input logic [3:0] control,
    output logic predicate
);

Now, let's implement the behavior of the comparison unit according to the provided ISA:

verilog

always_comb begin
    case (control)
        4'b0000: predicate = (in1 == 0); // VPSETZ
        4'b0001: predicate = (in1 != 0); // VPSETN
        4'b0010: predicate = 1;           // VPSET
        4'b0011: predicate = (in1 >= in2); // VPSGE
        4'b0100: predicate = (in1 < in2);  // VPSLT
        4'b0101: predicate = (in1 >= in2); // VPUGE, treating inputs as unsigned
        4'b0110: predicate = (in1 < in2);  // VPULT, treating inputs as unsigned
        4'b0111: predicate = (in1 == in2); // VPEQ
        4'b1000: predicate = (in1 != in2); // VPNEQ
        default: predicate = 0;            // Default case
    endcase
end

This code snippet describes the behavior of the comparison unit for the given instructions. Make sure to update the control signal according to the specific encoding scheme used in your design.

The signed comparisons you made are not actually signed

You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight. In Verilog, to perform signed comparisons, the operands must be explicitly declared as signed or cast to signed. Here's the corrected code snippet:

verilog

always_comb begin
    case (control)
        4'b0000: predicate = (in1 == 0); // VPSETZ
        4'b0001: predicate = (in1 != 0); // VPSETN
        4'b0010: predicate = 1;           // VPSET
        4'b0011: predicate = ($signed(in1) >= $signed(in2)); // VPSGE, signed comparison
        4'b0100: predicate = ($signed(in1) < $signed(in2));  // VPSLT, signed comparison
        4'b0101: predicate = (in1 >= in2); // VPUGE, treating inputs as unsigned
        4'b0110: predicate = (in1 < in2);  // VPULT, treating inputs as unsigned
        4'b0111: predicate = (in1 == in2); // VPEQ
        4'b1000: predicate = (in1 != in2); // VPNEQ
        default: predicate = 0;            // Default case
    endcase
end

I've used the $signed system function to cast the operands to signed for the VPSGE and VPSLT instructions. This ensures that the comparisons are performed using signed arithmetic, as required by the ISA. Thank you for pointing out the mistake!

Please print the entire module so I can copy and paste it.

Certainly! Here's the complete Verilog module for the comparison unit according to the provided ISA:

verilog

module comparison_unit #(parameter WIDTH = 32)(
    input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in1,
    input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in2,
    input logic [3:0] control,
    output logic predicate
);

always_comb begin
    case (control)
        4'b0000: predicate = (in1 == 0); // VPSETZ
        4'b0001: predicate = (in1 != 0); // VPSETN
        4'b0010: predicate = 1;           // VPSET
        4'b0011: predicate = ($signed(in1) >= $signed(in2)); // VPSGE, signed comparison
        4'b0100: predicate = ($signed(in1) < $signed(in2));  // VPSLT, signed comparison
        4'b0101: predicate = (in1 >= in2); // VPUGE, treating inputs as unsigned
        4'b0110: predicate = (in1 < in2);  // VPULT, treating inputs as unsigned
        4'b0111: predicate = (in1 == in2); // VPEQ
        4'b1000: predicate = (in1 != in2); // VPNEQ
        default: predicate = 0;            // Default case
    endcase
end

endmodule

You can copy and paste this code into your project. Make sure to align the control signal encoding with the rest of your design, as the specific encoding for each instruction must be consistent across the entire system.
