USER:
Write an implementation the following module using SystemVerilog: 

    Floating Point Adder/Subtractor: This unit takes two floating-point inputs and produces a floating-point output. It should have two modes of operation: addition and subtraction, selectable by a control signal.

My synthesis tool cannot synthesize the $bitstoreal  or any kind of system function. Include functionality that handles if the exponents are not the same, NaNs, infinites, and over/underflows

GPT4:
Here is a simple implementation of a floating point adder/subtractor in SystemVerilog. This implementation assumes IEEE 754 single-precision floating point format for the inputs and output.

Please note that this is a simplified version and does not include all the edge cases that you might encounter in a real-world scenario. It's recommended to use a well-tested library for floating point operations if you're working on a critical application.

This module first extracts the sign, exponent, and mantissa fields from the inputs. It then aligns the mantissas by shifting the mantissa of the input with the smaller exponent. The aligned mantissas are then added or subtracted based on the subtract signal. The result is normalized by shifting the mantissa and adjusting the exponent. Overflow and underflow are handled by saturating the exponent to its maximum or minimum value, and setting the mantissa to zero. NaN and infinity are handled by checking the exponent and mantissa of the inputs. The output is then constructed from the sign, exponent, and mantissa of the result.
