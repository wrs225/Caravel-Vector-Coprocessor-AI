USER:
Design the following modules using SystemVerilog:
Predicate Register File: This is a set of registers for storing predicate data. This module will have 32 bit registers of 32 elements each being 1 bit. There will be a read and write port on this register file. The read port will have 2 5-bit address ports to index into a vector and element in the vector. The write port will have a write enable and 2 5-bit address ports to select the write register.

GPT4:
Sure, here is a simple SystemVerilog design for the Predicate Register File.

verilog

module Predicate_Register_File
    #(parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 5, DATA_WIDTH = 1, NUM_REGISTERS = 32)
    (
        input logic clk, reset,
        input logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] read_addr1, read_addr2, write_addr1, write_addr2,
        input logic write_enable,
        output logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_out1, data_out2,
        input logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_in
    );

    // Declare register file
    logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] register_file [0:NUM_REGISTERS-1][0:NUM_REGISTERS-1];

    // Read operation
    always_comb begin
        data_out1 = register_file[read_addr1][read_addr2];
        data_out2 = register_file[read_addr1][read_addr2];
    end

    // Write operation
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            for (int i = 0; i < NUM_REGISTERS; i++) 
                for (int j = 0; j < NUM_REGISTERS; j++)
                    register_file[i][j] <= 0;
        end
        else if (write_enable) begin
            register_file[write_addr1][write_addr2] <= data_in;
        end
    end
endmodule

In this module:

    register_file is the 2D array of registers with each register is of size 1 bit.
    There are two address lines read_addr1, read_addr2, write_addr1, write_addr2 of size 5-bits for read and write operations.
    data_in is the input data for the write operation and data_out1, data_out2 are the output data for the read operation.
    The read operation is combinational and simply outputs the values at the selected addresses.
    The write operation is synchronous and only writes to the selected register when write_enable is asserted.
    During the reset, all the registers are cleared to zero.

USER:
You only need one output port

GPT4:
If you only need one output port, you can modify the design as follows:

verilog

module Predicate_Register_File
    #(parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 5, DATA_WIDTH = 1, NUM_REGISTERS = 32)
    (
        input logic clk, reset,
        input logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] read_addr1, read_addr2, 
        input logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] write_addr1, write_addr2,
        input logic write_enable,
        output logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_out,
        input logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_in
    );

    // Declare register file
    logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] register_file [0:NUM_REGISTERS-1][0:NUM_REGISTERS-1];

    // Read operation
    always_comb begin
        data_out = register_file[read_addr1][read_addr2];
    end

    // Write operation
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            for (int i = 0; i < NUM_REGISTERS; i++) 
                for (int j = 0; j < NUM_REGISTERS; j++)
                    register_file[i][j] <= 0;
        end
        else if (write_enable) begin
            register_file[write_addr1][write_addr2] <= data_in;
        end
    end
endmodule

In this module, there is only one output port, data_out, that is connected to the selected register in the register_file based on the addresses read_addr1 and read_addr2. The rest of the module's behavior is unchanged.
