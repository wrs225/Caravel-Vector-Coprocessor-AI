**You:**


Please write test cases for a 32-bit floating point adding and subtracting unit. Write a python file and define a function for each category of tests. In each function, create a list which contains lists of test cases where the first two elements are the inputs, the third element is 0 for addition or 1 for subtraction, and the last element is the result. Assume the adding and subtracting unit class is called fp_addsub and is defined elsewhere.

Certainly! Here's an example of a Python file with test cases for a 32-bit floating point adding and subtracting unit. Each category of tests is defined as a separate function, and a list of test cases is created within each function. The test cases include inputs, operation type (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction), and the expected result.

python
Copy code
from fp_addsub import FloatingPointAddSub  # Assuming the class name is FloatingPointAddSub

def test_addition():
    test_cases = [
        # Input1, Input2, Operation Type, Expected Result
        [1.5, 2.5, 0, 4.0],
        [0.0, 0.0, 0, 0.0],
        [-3.2, 1.7, 0, -1.5],
        [100.123, -50.321, 0, 49.802],
        [10.0, 0.0, 0, 10.0],
    ]

    for test in test_cases:
        input1, input2, op_type, expected_result = test
        result = FloatingPointAddSub.add(input1, input2)
        assert result == expected_result, f"Failed for inputs: {input1}, {input2}"

def test_subtraction():
    test_cases = [
        # Input1, Input2, Operation Type, Expected Result
        [5.0, 2.0, 1, 3.0],
        [0.0, 0.0, 1, 0.0],
        [-3.2, -1.7, 1, -1.5],
        [100.123, 50.321, 1, 49.802],
        [10.0, 10.0, 1, 0.0],
    ]

    for test in test_cases:
        input1, input2, op_type, expected_result = test
        result = FloatingPointAddSub.subtract(input1, input2)
        assert result == expected_result, f"Failed for inputs: {input1}, {input2}"

# Run the test functions
test_addition()
test_subtraction()


In this example, the FloatingPointAddSub class is assumed to have add() and subtract() methods that perform the respective operations. The test cases are defined within the test_addition() and test_subtraction() functions, and assertions are used to validate the results.

Note that you will need to define the FloatingPointAddSub class and its methods separately in the fp_addsub.py file or import it from an existing module.
