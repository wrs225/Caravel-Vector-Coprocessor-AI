For each test in this file, we need to add an instruction that enables the predicate register files so we can actually save the results of our computations. The opcode of this instruction is as follows:
VPSET	0x0E	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc.

It looks like you're working with vector operations and you want to add an instruction to enable the predicate register files. You've provided the opcode for the VPSET instruction, but it's not clear where you want to insert this instruction in your code.

Here's a general example of how you might use the VPSET instruction in your code:

python

VPSET_OPCODE = 0x0E

def vpset_instruction(dut, Pdest, Ssrc):
  # Create the VPSET instruction
  vpset_instruction = (VPSET_OPCODE << 27) | (Pdest << 21) | (Ssrc << 16)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, vpset_instruction)

  # You can add additional code here to perform any necessary checks or operations

You would then call this function at the appropriate place in your code, passing in the values for Pdest and Ssrc that you want to use.

Without more specific information about how you want to use the VPSET instruction, it's hard to provide more detailed guidance. If you can provide more context or ask a more specific question, I'll be happy to help further!

Modify this code to include a call to vpset_instruction with the proper register selected for each test contained within this file. Please be aware you must set Pdest and Ssrc to the register that we are going to write to after conducting the operation. 
ChatGPT

Certainly! You can modify the code to include a call to the vpset_instruction function with the proper register selected for each test. Here's an example of how you can do this:

First, define a function to create the VPSET instruction and write it to the instruction address:

python

VPSET_OPCODE = 0x0E

def vpset_instruction(dut, Pdest, Ssrc):
    instruction = (VPSET_OPCODE << 27) | (Pdest << 21) | (Ssrc << 16)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, instruction)

Now, you can call this function before each operation in the test functions. Here's an example of how you can modify the vector_add_operation function:

python

def vector_add_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  BASE_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  NUM_REGISTERS = 32
  INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS = 0x30000000
  VADD_OPCODE = 0x02

  # Store 1 in the first 32 * 2 registers
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS * 2):
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    wb_write(dut, register_address, 1)

  # Set the predicate register for the destination
  Pdest = 2
  Ssrc = 2
  vpset_instruction(dut, Pdest, Ssrc)

  # Add the two vectors together
  add_instruction = (VADD_OPCODE << 27) | (Pdest << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

  # Read and check the results from the third vector register
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS * 2) * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
    assert read_data == 2, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result 2 at address {register_address}"

  print("Vector add operation passed!")

You can follow the same pattern for the other test functions, making sure to set Pdest and Ssrc to the appropriate values for each operation.

This code now uses the correct addresses for DATA_START_ADDRESS and SCALAR_ADDRESS. Make sure that the vpset_instruction function is defined elsewhere in your code, and adjust the VSADD_OPCODE constant if needed.

VSADD's opcode is 0x06
ChatGPT

Got it! Here's the corrected code with the updated opcode for the scalar add operation:

python

def scalar_add_operation(dut):
    # Define some constants for the test
    DATA_START_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
    NUM_REGISTERS = 32
    INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS = 0x30000000
    SCALAR_ADDRESS = 0x30001004
    VSADD_OPCODE = 0x06  # Updated opcode for scalar add

    # Generate random inputs
    inputs = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]
    scalar = random.randint(0, 100)

    # Store the inputs in the first 32 registers
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
        wb_write(dut, register_address, inputs[i])

    # Store the scalar
    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar)

    # Perform the scalar add operation
    add_instruction = (VSADD_OPCODE << 27) | (1 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (0 << 11)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    # Read and check the results from the second vector register
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        expected_result = inputs[i] + scalar
        assert read_data == expected_result, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result {expected_result} at address {register_address}"

    print("Scalar add operation passed!")

This code now uses the correct opcode 0x06 for the scalar add operation. Make sure to adjust other parts of the code if needed, such as the encoding of the instruction or the handling of the predicate registers, based on your specific requirements.

You forgot the additional register enable instruction
ChatGPT

Apologies for missing that part. If you need to include a call to a vpset_instruction function to set the proper register for the operation, you'll need to know the exact details of how that function is defined and what parameters it requires.

Assuming you have a function like vpset_instruction(dut, Pdest, Ssrc) that sets the proper register, you can include a call to that function in your code. Here's an example of how you might modify the scalar_add_operation function:

python

def scalar_add_operation(dut):
    # Define some constants for the test
    DATA_START_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
    NUM_REGISTERS = 32
    INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS = 0x30000000
    SCALAR_ADDRESS = 0x30001004
    VSADD_OPCODE = 0x06

    # Generate random inputs
    inputs = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]
    scalar = random.randint(0, 100)

    # Store the inputs in the first 32 registers
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)
        wb_write(dut, register_address, inputs[i])

    # Store the scalar
    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar)

    # Set the proper register (replace with the correct values for Pdest and Ssrc)
    Pdest = 1
    Ssrc = 0
    vpset_instruction(dut, Pdest, Ssrc)

    # Perform the scalar add operation
    add_instruction = (VSADD_OPCODE << 27) | (Pdest << 21) | (Ssrc << 16) | (0 << 11)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    # Read and check the results from the second vector register
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        expected_result = inputs[i] + scalar
        assert read_data == expected_result, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result {expected_result} at address {register_address}"

    print("Scalar add operation passed!")

Please replace Pdest and Ssrc with the correct values for your specific implementation, and make sure the vpset_instruction function is defined elsewhere in your code with the correct behavior.

Certainly! It seems like you're testing edge cases for scalar addition, including overflow and underflow. Based on the previous context, I'll include the necessary constants and the call to the vpset_instruction function if needed.

Here's the corrected code:

        assert read_data == expected, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result {expected} at address {register_address}"
