When testing hardware or co-processors, it's crucial to consider edge cases that might cause unexpected behaviors. Especially when dealing with arithmetic operations, a few critical edge cases might be:

Overflow and Underflow: If the scalar addition results in values that exceed the representation capacity (in this case, 32-bit integer), there should be a mechanism to handle this. Overflow can happen with two large positive numbers, and underflow can occur with a large negative number and a positive number.

Minimum and Maximum Values: Testing the minimum (0x00000000) and maximum (0xFFFFFFFF) representable numbers for any issues.

Scalar Value Edge Cases: What happens when the scalar value is the minimum or the maximum possible value?

Here are some edge test cases based on the above considerations:

python
Copy code
def scalar_add_edge_cases(dut):
    # Case 1: Overflow and underflow
    inputs = [0xFFFFFFFF, 0x7FFFFFFF, 0x80000000, 0x00000001]
    scalar = 0x00000001

    # Store the inputs
    for i, value in enumerate(inputs):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)
        wb_write(dut, register_address, value)

    # Store the scalar
    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar)

    # Perform the scalar add operation
    add_instruction = (VSADD_OPCODE << 27) | (1 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (0 << 11)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    # Expected results considering a wrap-around for overflows
    expected_results = [0x00000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000001, 0x00000002]

    # Read and check the results
    for i, expected in enumerate(expected_results):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        assert read_data == expected, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result {expected} at address {register_address}"

    print("Scalar add edge cases passed!")

def test_scalar_add_edge_cases(cmdline_opts):
    # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
    dut = WrapperBlock()
    dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts(dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[])
    dut.apply(DefaultPassGroup(linetrace=False))

    # Reset the simulation
    dut.sim_reset()

    # Perform the scalar add edge cases
    scalar_add_edge_cases(dut)


You should adapt the expected results according to the behavior of the co-processor when handling overflows and underflows.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Are there any other edge cases you think would be good to add?
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Beyond the basic overflow and underflow scenarios, there are several edge cases that can be considered, especially when testing mathematical operations in hardware:

Zeros:

Scalar is zero: This is interesting because adding 0 should not change any value.
Input data is all zeros: Testing with all zeros ensures that the scalar value is being correctly propagated to all output locations.

Complementary Values:

Inputs are such that they negate the scalar. For example, if the scalar is 5, then one of the inputs is -5. The result should be zero.

Randomized Scalar:

In the tests above, we've considered a static scalar for all the inputs. But, what if the scalar itself changes between operations?

Boundary Addresses:

It's a good practice to test the first and last addresses in your defined range. These can sometimes behave differently if there are addressing issues.

Stress Test:

Rapidly issue scalar add operations without waiting for previous operations to complete (assuming the design can handle concurrent operations).

Let's provide a function for the first three new edge cases:

python
Copy code
def scalar_add_additional_edge_cases(dut):
    # Case 1: Scalar is zero and Input data is all zeros
    inputs_zero = [0 for _ in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]
    scalar_zero = 0

    # Store the inputs
    for i, value in enumerate(inputs_zero):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)
        wb_write(dut, register_address, value)

    # Store the scalar
    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar_zero)

    # Perform the scalar add operation
    add_instruction = (VSADD_OPCODE << 27) | (1 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (0 << 11)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    # Read and check the results
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        assert read_data == 0, f"Read data {read_data} is not zero at address {register_address}"

    # Case 2: Complementary values
    scalar_complement = random.randint(1, 100)
    inputs_complement = [-scalar_complement for _ in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]

    for i, value in enumerate(inputs_complement):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)
        wb_write(dut, register_address, value)

    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar_complement)

    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        assert read_data == 0, f"Read data {read_data} is not zero at address {register_address}"

    print("Scalar add additional edge cases passed!")

def test_scalar_add_additional_edge_cases(cmdline_opts):
    # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
    dut = WrapperBlock()
    dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts(dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[])
    dut.apply(DefaultPassGroup(linetrace=False))

    # Reset the simulation
    dut.sim_reset()

    # Perform the scalar add additional edge cases
    scalar_add_additional_edge_cases(dut)


Remember to adjust these cases based on your hardware's behavior, especially when considering negative numbers and their representations (e.g., Two's Complement).
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Great! Please split these two into different sets of functions and give them meaningful names
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Absolutely, I'll split the cases into different functions and provide meaningful names for each of them:

Testing with Zeros:
This will have two sub-cases:
Scalar is zero.
Input data is all zeros.
Complementary Value Testing:
We're testing inputs that negate the scalar, resulting in zeros.

Here's the split:

python
Copy code
def scalar_add_with_zeros(dut):
    # Inputs are all zeros and scalar is zero
    inputs_zero = [0 for _ in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]
    scalar_zero = 0

    # Store the inputs
    for i, value in enumerate(inputs_zero):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)
        wb_write(dut, register_address, value)

    # Store the scalar
    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar_zero)

    # Perform the scalar add operation
    add_instruction = (VSADD_OPCODE << 27) | (1 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (0 << 11)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    # Read and check the results
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        assert read_data == 0, f"Read data {read_data} is not zero at address {register_address}"

    print("Scalar add with zeros test passed!")

def complementary_value_test(dut):
    # Inputs negate the scalar
    scalar_complement = random.randint(1, 100)
    inputs_complement = [-scalar_complement for _ in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]

    # Store the inputs
    for i, value in enumerate(inputs_complement):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + (i * 4)
        wb_write(dut, register_address, value)

    # Store the scalar
    wb_write(dut, SCALAR_ADDRESS, scalar_complement)

    # Perform the scalar add operation
    add_instruction = (VSADD_OPCODE << 27) | (1 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (0 << 11)
    wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

    # Read and check the results
    for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
        register_address = DATA_START_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS) * 4)
        read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
        assert read_data == 0, f"Read data {read_data} is not zero at address {register_address}"

    print("Complementary value test passed!")

def test_scalar_add_with_zeros(cmdline_opts):
    # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
    dut = WrapperBlock()
    dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts(dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[])
    dut.apply(DefaultPassGroup(linetrace=False))

    # Reset the simulation
    dut.sim_reset()

    # Perform the scalar add with zeros test
    scalar_add_with_zeros(dut)

def test_complementary_value(cmdline_opts):
    # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
    dut = WrapperBlock()
    dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts(dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[])
    dut.apply(DefaultPassGroup(linetrace=False))

    # Reset the simulation
    dut.sim_reset()

    # Perform the complementary value test
    complementary_value_test(dut)


Now you have two distinct tests: test_scalar_add_with_zeros to test the scalar addition with zeros and test_complementary_value to test the scalar addition with complementary values.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Thank you! Now can you please write a test for the boundary address edge case you suggested?
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Absolutely! Testing the boundary addresses ensures that your addressing mechanism is functioning properly for both the start and the end of the specified address range.

Here's a test for the boundary addresses:

python
Copy code
def boundary_address_test(dut):
    # Generate random values for the start and end of the address range
    start_value = random.randint(0, 0xFFFFFFFF)
    end_value = random.randint(0, 0xFFFFFFFF)

    # Write to the starting address
    wb_write(dut, START_ADDRESS, start_value)

    # Write to the ending address
    wb_write(dut, END_ADDRESS, end_value)

    # Read from the starting address and verify
    read_start_value = wb_read(dut, START_ADDRESS)
    assert read_start_value == start_value, f"Read data {read_start_value} does not match written data {start_value} at start address {START_ADDRESS}"

    # Read from the ending address and verify
    read_end_value = wb_read(dut, END_ADDRESS)
    assert read_end_value == end_value, f"Read data {read_end_value} does not match written data {end_value} at end address {END_ADDRESS}"

    print("Boundary address test passed!")

def test_boundary_address(cmdline_opts):
    # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
    dut = WrapperBlock()
    dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts(dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[])
    dut.apply(DefaultPassGroup(linetrace=False))

    # Reset the simulation
    dut.sim_reset()

    # Perform the boundary address test
    boundary_address_test(dut)


With this test_boundary_address function, you can now validate the functionality of both the start and end of your address range.
