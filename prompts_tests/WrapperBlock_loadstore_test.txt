User
I have the following python file called wishbone_interface_driver with the following code:
from pymtl3 import *

def wb_tr( dut, stb, cyc, we, sel, dat, adr):
    dut.wb_rst_i  @= 0
    dut.wbs_stb_i @= stb
    dut.wbs_cyc_i @= cyc
    dut.wbs_we_i  @= we
    dut.wbs_sel_i @= sel
    dut.wbs_dat_i @= dat
    dut.wbs_adr_i @= adr

    dut.sim_tick()

    return dut.wbs_ack_o, dut.wbs_dat_o

def wb_write(dut, address, data):
    # Start the transaction
    ack, _ = wb_tr(dut, 1, 1, 1, 0xF, data, address)
    # Wait for acknowledgment
    while not ack:
        ack, _ = wb_tr(dut, 1, 1, 1, 0xF, data, address)
    # End the transaction
    wb_tr(dut, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

def wb_read(dut, address):
    # Start the transaction
    ack, data = wb_tr(dut, 1, 1, 0, 0xF, 0, address)
    # Wait for acknowledgment
    while not ack:
        ack, data = wb_tr(dut, 1, 1, 0, 0xF, 0, address)
    # End the transaction
    wb_tr(dut, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

    return data

I also happen to have a block with the following interface:
from pymtl3 import *
from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import *

class WrapperBlock( VerilogPlaceholder, Component ):

  # Constructor
  def construct( s ):

    # Inputs
    s.wb_clk_i  = InPort ( Bits1 )
    s.wb_rst_i  = InPort ( Bits1 )
    s.wbs_stb_i = InPort ( Bits1 )
    s.wbs_cyc_i = InPort ( Bits1 )
    s.wbs_we_i  = InPort ( Bits1 )
    s.wbs_sel_i = InPort ( Bits4 )
    s.wbs_dat_i = InPort ( Bits32 )
    s.wbs_adr_i = InPort ( Bits32 )

    # Outputs
    s.wbs_ack_o = OutPort( Bits1 )
    s.wbs_dat_o = OutPort( Bits32 )

# Define the variable outside of the class
wrapperblock = WrapperBlock

Can you please make a file which drives the tester with the provided helper functions and makes a simple load-store test with a similar interface to this test, which I created for a different ASIC in the past?
def test_loopback( cmdline_opts ):


  dut = FFTInterconnectVRTL()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  dut.sim_reset()
  loopback(dut)

Another thing: The ISA is as follows
Instruction	Opcode	Operand 1	Operand 2	Operand 3	Description
VLOAD	0x00	Vdest	Saddr	Slen	Load a vector from memory into Vdest. The base address is in Saddr, and the length is in Slen.
VSTORE	0x01	Vsrc	Saddr	Slen	Store a vector from Vsrc to memory. The base address is in Saddr, and the length is in Slen.
VADD	0x02	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Add two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 + Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VSUB	0x03	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Subtract two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 - Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VMUL	0x04	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Multiply two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 * Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VSMUL	0x05	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Multiply a vector by a scalar. Vsrc * Ssrc -> Vdest.
VSADD	0x06	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Add a scalar to a vector. Vsrc + Ssrc -> Vdest.
VFADD	0x07	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Add two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 + Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VFMUL	0x08	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Multiply two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 * Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VAND	0x09	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise AND operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 AND Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VOR	0x0A	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise OR operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 OR Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VXOR	0x0B	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise XOR operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 XOR Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VPSETZ	0x0C	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc that is zero, and 0 otherwise.
VPSETN	0x0D	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc that is non-zero, and 0 otherwise.
VPSET	0x0E	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc.
VPGT	0x0F	Pdest	Ssrc1	Ssrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc1 that is greater than the corresponding element in Ssrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VFSUB	0x10	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Subtract two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 - Vsrc2 -> Vdest.

A Load store command is implied if the address is >= 0x30000004
ChatGPT

Certainly! Based on the provided information, I'll create a test file that drives the tester and performs a simple load-store test using the Wishbone interface. Since the ISA is provided, I'll assume that the address 0x30000004 or higher is used for load and store operations.

Here's the code for the test file:

python

from pymtl3 import *
from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import *
from wishbone_interface_driver import wb_write, wb_read, WrapperBlock

def test_wrapper_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the load-store test
  load_store_test(dut)

def load_store_test(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  LOAD_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  STORE_ADDRESS = 0x30000008
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the LOAD_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, LOAD_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the LOAD_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, LOAD_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data
  assert read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {TEST_DATA}"

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the STORE_ADDRESS with the read data
  wb_write(dut, STORE_ADDRESS, read_data)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the STORE_ADDRESS
  final_read_data = wb_read(dut, STORE_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the final read data matches the initial written data
  assert final_read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Final read data {final_read_data} does not match initial written data {TEST_DATA}"

  print("Load-store test passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  test_wrapper_block( sys.argv[1:] )

This test file includes a function load_store_test that performs a simple load-store test using the provided Wishbone interface. It writes data to a load address, reads it back, verifies it, writes it to a store address, reads it back again, and verifies it. If everything matches, it prints a success message.

You can run this test by executing the Python file from the command line, passing any necessary command-line options. Make sure that the wishbone_interface_driver module is accessible from the location where you run the test.

For this function: load_store_test(dut), you cannot have _test in the name, as that will cause pytest to run this function and it will probably error
ChatGPT

Certainly! You can rename the function to avoid conflicts with pytest. Here's the updated code snippet:

python

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  LOAD_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  STORE_ADDRESS = 0x30000008
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the LOAD_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, LOAD_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the LOAD_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, LOAD_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data
  assert read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {TEST_DATA}"

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the STORE_ADDRESS with the read data
  wb_write(dut, STORE_ADDRESS, read_data)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the STORE_ADDRESS
  final_read_data = wb_read(dut, STORE_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the final read data matches the initial written data
  assert final_read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Final read data {final_read_data} does not match initial written data {TEST_DATA}"

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

And you would also update the call to this function in the test_wrapper_block function:

python

def test_wrapper_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # ...
  load_store_operation(dut) # Updated function name

This change should prevent pytest from automatically running the function as a test.
User
Can you please write and read from the same address?
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's the updated code snippet that writes to and reads from the same address:

python

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  TEST_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the TEST_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, TEST_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the TEST_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, TEST_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data
  assert read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {TEST_DATA}"

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

This code writes data to a specific address and then reads from the same address, verifying that the read data matches the written data. If everything matches, it prints a success message.
User
Excellent, last can you please print the entire file to confirm understanding?
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's the entire file that includes the test function and the load-store operation:

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  test_wrapper_block( sys.argv[1:] )

This code includes the main test function test_wrapper_block, which sets up the device under test (DUT) and calls the load_store_operation function to perform the load-store operation. The load_store_operation function writes data to a specific address and reads from the same address, verifying that the read data matches the written data. If everything matches, it prints a success message.
User
Can you please import wrapperblock from WrapperBlock.WrapperBlock
ChatGPT

Certainly! You can import the WrapperBlock class from the WrapperBlock module by using the following import statement:

python

from WrapperBlock.WrapperBlock import wrapperblock

Here's the updated code with the correct import:

python

from pymtl3 import *
from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import *
from wishbone_interface_driver import wb_write, wb_read
from WrapperBlock.WrapperBlock import wrapperblock

def test_wrapper_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = wrapperblock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the load-store operation
  load_store_operation(dut)

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  TEST_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the TEST_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, TEST_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the TEST_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, TEST_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  test_wrapper_block( sys.argv[1:] )

Make sure that the WrapperBlock module is accessible from the location where you run the test, and that the wrapperblock variable is defined in the WrapperBlock module as shown in your original code snippet.

wrapperblock should use case WrapperBlock
ChatGPT

Certainly! My apologies for the confusion. Here's the corrected code:

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys

I've updated the import and instantiation to use the correct case for WrapperBlock. Thank you for pointing that out!
User
make from wishbone_interface_driver into from .wishbone_interface_driver
ChatGPT

Sure, if you want to import from a module in the same directory, you can use a relative import. Here's the updated code:

python

from pymtl3 import *
from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import *
from .wishbone_interface_driver import wb_write, wb_read
from WrapperBlock.WrapperBlock import WrapperBlock

def test_wrapper_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the load-store operation
  load_store_operation(dut)

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  TEST_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the TEST_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, TEST_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the TEST_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, TEST_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data
  assert read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {TEST_DATA}"

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  test_wrapper_block( sys.argv[1:] )

Please note that relative imports like this one only work if the script is being imported as a module, not if it's being run as a standalone script. If you're running this script directly, you might need to use an absolute import instead.
User
Add this import:
from pymtl3.stdlib.test_utils import mk_test_case_table, run_sim, config_model_with_cmdline_opts

from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import *
from pymtl3.stdlib.test_utils import mk_test_case_table, run_sim, config_model_with_cmdline_opts

  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the load-store operation
  load_store_operation(dut)

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  TEST_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the TEST_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, TEST_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the TEST_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, TEST_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  test_wrapper_block( sys.argv[1:] )

The mk_test_case_table, run_sim, and config_model_with_cmdline_opts functions from the pymtl3.stdlib.test_utils module are now imported and can be used in your test.

Now, I want to add a test which writes and reads from every register file address, there are 32 * 32 registers in the register file, with the first register starting at address 0x30000004. Please implement this test
ChatGPT

Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can implement a test that writes and reads from every register file address:

python

def test_all_registers(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  BASE_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  NUM_REGISTERS = 32 * 32

  # Iterate over all register addresses
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    # Calculate the address of the current register
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes

    # Generate some test data for this register
    test_data = i  # Or any other function of i

    # Perform a write operation (store) to the current register
    wb_write(dut, register_address, test_data)

    # Perform a read operation (load) from the current register
    read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)

    # Verify that the read data matches the written data
    assert read_data == test_data, f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {test_data} at address {register_address}"

  print("All register test passed!")

You can call this function from your test_wrapper_block function to include it in your test:

python

def test_wrapper_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # ...
  test_all_registers(dut)

This test writes a unique value to each register and then reads it back, verifying that the read data matches the written data. If everything matches, it prints a success message. If not, it raises an assertion error with a message indicating the address of the failing register.
User
Can you please read from the registers only after writing to all of them?
ChatGPT

Sure, you can first write to all registers and then read from them in separate loops. Here's how you can modify the test_all_registers function to do this:

python

def test_all_registers(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  BASE_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  NUM_REGISTERS = 32 * 32

  # Create a list to store the test data for each register
  test_data_list = [i for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]  # Or any other function of i

  # First, write to all registers
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    # Calculate the address of the current register
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes

    # Perform a write operation (store) to the current register
    wb_write(dut, register_address, test_data_list[i])

  # Then, read from all registers and verify the data
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    # Calculate the address of the current register
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes

    # Perform a read operation (load) from the current register
    read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)

    # Verify that the read data matches the written data
    assert read_data == test_data_list[i], f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {test_data_list[i]} at address {register_address}"

  print("All register test passed!")

This version of the function first writes a unique value to each register in one loop, and then reads back and verifies the data in a separate loop. If the read data matches the written data for all registers, it prints a success message. If not, it raises an assertion error with a message indicating the address of the failing register.

You can't have test_ in the function name test_all_registers(dut):

I see, you want to avoid the test_ prefix to prevent pytest from automatically running the function. Let's rename the function to all_registers_operation. Here's the updated code:

python

  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Test all registers
  all_registers_operation(dut)

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  TEST_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  TEST_DATA = 0xDEADBEEF

  # Perform a write operation (store) to the TEST_ADDRESS
  wb_write(dut, TEST_ADDRESS, TEST_DATA)

  # Perform a read operation (load) from the TEST_ADDRESS
  read_data = wb_read(dut, TEST_ADDRESS)

  # Verify that the read data matches the written data
  assert read_data == TEST_DATA, f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {TEST_DATA}"

  print("Load-store operation passed!")

def all_registers_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  BASE_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  NUM_REGISTERS = 32 * 32

  # Create a list to store the test data for each register
  test_data_list = [i for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS)]  # Or any other function of i

  # First, write to all registers
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    # Calculate the address of the current register
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes

    # Perform a write operation (store) to the current register
    wb_write(dut, register_address, test_data_list[i])

  # Then, read from all registers and verify the data
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):

    # Verify that the read data matches the written data
    assert read_data == test_data_list[i], f"Read data {read_data} does not match written data {test_data_list[i]} at address {register_address}"

  print("All register operation passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  test_wrapper_block( sys.argv[1:] )
  test_all_registers_block( sys.argv[1:] )

The function all_registers_operation now performs the operation of writing to and reading from all registers. The function test_all_registers_block is the test function that sets up the DUT and calls all_registers_operation.

The import statement now correctly imports WrapperBlock from sim.WrapperBlock.

These test cases are for a register architecture, where we are doing operations on vectors of registers. Next, lets try to make a new test which stores 1 in the first 32 * 2 registers and adds them together, storing the result in the third vector register and reading them out, checking them one-at-a time. To do this, we store the vectors much like we already have. Then, we send the add instruction to wishbone address 0x30000000. We then read all 32 individual registers in vector register 3.
As a reminder, this is the ISA and package formats:
Instruction	Opcode	Operand 1	Operand 2	Operand 3	Description
VLOAD	0x00	Vdest	Saddr	Slen	Load a vector from memory into Vdest. The base address is in Saddr, and the length is in Slen.
VSTORE	0x01	Vsrc	Saddr	Slen	Store a vector from Vsrc to memory. The base address is in Saddr, and the length is in Slen.
VADD	0x02	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Add two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 + Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VSUB	0x03	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Subtract two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 - Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VMUL	0x04	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Multiply two vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 * Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VSMUL	0x05	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Multiply a vector by a scalar. Vsrc * Ssrc -> Vdest.
VSADD	0x06	Vdest	Vsrc	Ssrc	Add a scalar to a vector. Vsrc + Ssrc -> Vdest.
VFADD	0x07	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Add two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 + Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VFMUL	0x08	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Multiply two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 * Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VAND	0x09	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise AND operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 AND Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VOR	0x0A	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise OR operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 OR Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VXOR	0x0B	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Perform bitwise XOR operation on two integer vectors. Vsrc1 XOR Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
VPSETZ	0x0C	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc that is zero, and 0 otherwise.
VPSETN	0x0D	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc that is non-zero, and 0 otherwise.
VPSET	0x0E	Pdest	Ssrc	-	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc.
VPGT	0x0F	Pdest	Ssrc1	Ssrc2	Set predicate register Pdest to 1 for each element in Ssrc1 that is greater than the corresponding element in Ssrc2, and 0 otherwise.
VFSUB	0x10	Vdest	Vsrc1	Vsrc2	Subtract two floating-point vectors element-wise. Vsrc1 - Vsrc2 -> Vdest.
        reg_file_addr1 = instruction[20:16];
        reg_file_addr2 = instruction[15:11];
        vector_reg_write_select = instruction[25:21];
        opcode = instruction[31:27];
ChatGPT

Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can implement a test that stores 1 in the first 32 * 2 registers, adds them together, stores the result in the third vector register, and then reads and checks the results:

python

def vector_add_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  BASE_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  NUM_REGISTERS = 32
  INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS = 0x30000000
  VADD_OPCODE = 0x02

  # Store 1 in the first 32 * 2 registers
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS * 2):
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    wb_write(dut, register_address, 1)

  # Add the two vectors together
  # The instruction is encoded as follows:
  # - Bits [31:27]: Opcode
  # - Bits [26:21]: Destination vector register (3)
  # - Bits [20:16]: Source vector register 1 (0)
  # - Bits [15:11]: Source vector register 2 (1)
  # - Bits [10:0]: Unused
  add_instruction = (VADD_OPCODE << 27) | (3 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

  # Read and check the results from the third vector register
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS * 2) * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
    assert read_data == 2, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result 2 at address {register_address}"

  print("Vector add operation passed!")

You can call this function from your test_wrapper_block or test_all_registers_block function to include it in your test:

python

def test_wrapper_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # ...
  vector_add_operation(dut)

This test writes 1 to the first 32 * 2 registers, sends an add instruction to the instruction address, and then reads back and verifies the results from the third vector register. If the read data matches the expected result for all registers, it prints a success message. If not, it raises an assertion error with a message indicating the address of the failing register.

I see, if the 26th bit is not used, the encoding of the instruction would change slightly. Here's the updated code:

python

def vector_add_operation(dut):
  # Define some constants for the test
  BASE_ADDRESS = 0x30000004
  NUM_REGISTERS = 32
  INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS = 0x30000000

  # Store 1 in the first 32 * 2 registers
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS * 2):
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    wb_write(dut, register_address, 1)

  # Add the two vectors together
  # The instruction is encoded as follows:
  # - Bits [31:27]: Opcode
  # - Bits [25:21]: Destination vector register (3)
  # - Bits [20:16]: Source vector register 1 (0)
  # - Bits [15:11]: Source vector register 2 (1)
  # - Bits [10:0]: Unused
  add_instruction = (VADD_OPCODE << 27) | (3 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, add_instruction)

  # Read and check the results from the third vector register
  for i in range(NUM_REGISTERS):
    register_address = BASE_ADDRESS + ((i + NUM_REGISTERS * 2) * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
    assert read_data == 2, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result 2 at address {register_address}"

  print("Vector add operation passed!")

In this updated code, the destination vector register is shifted by 21 bits instead of 22, taking into account that the 26th bit is not used.

You also need to include a function with test_ in the name to instantiate the WrapperBlock and run the test

I see, you want a function that pytest can automatically discover and run. Here's how you can add a function named test_vector_operations that instantiates WrapperBlock and runs the vector_add_operation test:

python

  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the load-store operation
  load_store_operation(dut)

def test_all_registers_block( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Test all registers

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector add operation
  vector_add_operation(dut)

def load_store_operation(dut):
  # ...

Please change this line:
  add_instruction = (VADD_OPCODE << 27) | (3 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
so we write to register 2 instead of 3
ChatGPT

Sure, here's the updated line where we write to register 2 instead of 3:

python

add_instruction = (VADD_OPCODE << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)

This line creates an instruction to add the vectors in registers 0 and 1 and store the result in register 2. The opcode for the add operation is shifted to the left by 27 bits, the destination register is shifted to the left by 21 bits, and the source registers are shifted to the left by 16 and 11 bits respectively.

Sure, I can create separate test functions for each of these operations. For simplicity, I'll use the same setup as in the vector_add_operation function: storing 1 in the first 32 * 2 registers, performing the operation, and then reading back and verifying the results from the third vector register. Here are the functions:

python

def vector_sub_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Subtract the two vectors
  sub_instruction = (0x03 << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, sub_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

def vector_mul_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Multiply the two vectors
  mul_instruction = (0x04 << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, mul_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

def vector_fadd_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Add the two floating-point vectors
  fadd_instruction = (0x07 << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, fadd_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

def vector_fmul_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Multiply the two floating-point vectors
  fmul_instruction = (0x08 << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, fmul_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

def vector_and_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Perform bitwise AND operation on the two vectors
  and_instruction = (0x09 << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, and_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

def vector_or_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Perform bitwise OR operation on the two vectors
  or_instruction = (0x0A << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, or_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

def vector_xor_operation(dut):
  # ...
  # (same setup as before)

  # Perform bitwise XOR operation on the two vectors
  xor_instruction = (0x0B << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS, xor_instruction)

  # ...
  # (same verification as before)

You can add these functions to your test file and call them in a similar way to the vector_add_operation function. Note that you'll need to adjust the verification part of each function to match the expected results of the operation. For example, for the vector_sub_operation function, you'll need to check that the result is 0 (since we're subtracting two vectors of 1s), and for the vector_mul_operation function, you'll need to check that the result is 1 (since we're multiplying two vectors of 1s).

Can you please separate them into separate tests?
ChatGPT

Sure, here are the separate test functions for each operation:

python

def test_vector_add( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector add operation
  vector_add_operation(dut)

def test_vector_sub( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector sub operation
  vector_sub_operation(dut)

def test_vector_mul( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector mul operation
  vector_mul_operation(dut)

def test_vector_and( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector and operation
  vector_and_operation(dut)

def test_vector_or( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector or operation
  vector_or_operation(dut)

def test_vector_xor( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the vector xor operation
  vector_xor_operation(dut)

Each of these functions instantiates the device under test (DUT), applies the default pass group, resets the simulation, and then performs the respective vector operation.

Can you please create random tests for these r-r instructions?
ChatGPT

Sure, here's an example of how you could create random tests for these register-to-register instructions. We'll use the Python random module to generate random inputs for the tests.

python

import random

def random_test_vector_add( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Generate random inputs
  num_registers = 32
  base_address = 0x30000004
  instruction_address = 0x30000000
  inputs = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(num_registers * 2)]

  # Store the inputs in the first 32 * 2 registers
  for i in range(num_registers * 2):
    register_address = base_address + (i * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    wb_write(dut, register_address, inputs[i])

  # Perform the vector add operation
  add_instruction = (0x02 << 27) | (2 << 21) | (0 << 16) | (1 << 11)
  wb_write(dut, instruction_address, add_instruction)

  # Read and check the results from the third vector register
  for i in range(num_registers):
    register_address = base_address + ((i + num_registers * 2) * 4)  # Assuming each register is 4 bytes
    read_data = wb_read(dut, register_address)
    expected_result = inputs[i] + inputs[i + num_registers]
    assert read_data == expected_result, f"Read data {read_data} does not match expected result {expected_result} at address {register_address}"

  print("Random test for vector add operation passed!")

This function generates random inputs, stores them in the first 32 * 2 registers, performs the vector add operation, and then checks the results. You can create similar random tests for the other operations by following the same pattern.
User
Can you please create the driver function for this?
ChatGPT

Sure, here's how you could create a driver function for the random test:

python

def test_random_vector_add( cmdline_opts ):
  # Instantiate the DUT (Device Under Test)
  dut = WrapperBlock()
  dut = config_model_with_cmdline_opts( dut, cmdline_opts, duts=[] )
  dut.apply( DefaultPassGroup( linetrace=False ) )

  # Reset the simulation
  dut.sim_reset()

  # Perform the random test for vector add operation
  random_test_vector_add(dut)

This function instantiates the device under test (DUT), applies the default pass group, resets the simulation, and then performs the random test for the vector add operation. You can create similar driver functions for the other operations by following the same pattern.
